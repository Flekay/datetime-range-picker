# datetime-range-picker
A lightweight, dependency-free JavaScript library for selecting date and time ranges. This project is based on [alumuko's vanilla-datetimerange-picker](alumuko/vanilla-datetimerange-picker), which itself is a modification of [Dan Grossman's bootstrap-daterangepicker](https://github.com/dangrossman/daterangepicker).
